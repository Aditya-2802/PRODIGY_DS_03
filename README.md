## Decision Tree download

# Overview
This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Project Structure
- data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.

- bank-additional-full.csv: The dataset in CSV format.

- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

- Customer_Purchase_Prediction.ipynb: The main notebook where the decision tree classifier is built and evaluated. -images/: Images and visualizations generated by the project. 

- README.md: This README file, providing an overview of the project.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ Required Python libraries can be installed using pip: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Usage 1.Clone the repository to your local machine:

- git clone: https://github.com/Aditya28/PRODIGY_DS_03/blob/main/PRODIGY_DS_03.ipynb
- Navigate to the project directory: cd decision-tree-customer-prediction

- Run the Jupyter notebook Customer_Purchase_Prediction.ipynb to explore the project and train the decision tree classifier.

# Model Training and Evaluation
- The decision tree classifier is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
# Results
- The final decision tree classifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test data.
- The trained decision tree is visualized and saved as decision_tree in Download.png.
